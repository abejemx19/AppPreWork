## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
*Encountered problems with the button.setOnClickListener section as I initially stuck with the 
default button.setOnClickListener() instead of the intended button.setOnClickListener{}, which had me 
creating a separate private class which still was'nt running. Took me about 20 minutes to figure out 
the problem here.
* I got the error message "initial commit failed android studio. cannot read..." when initially 
trying to commit the file onto github. I was able to get that section sorted out by following 
the tutorial on this page "https://blog.krybot.com/a?ID=00550-ed7d47ea-3066-4792-990b-43345d3669ff"
